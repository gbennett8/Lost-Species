# Lost-Species
An analysis of all terrestrial vertebrates listed in the IUCN redlist. 
We identified a total of 562 'lost' species (those which have not been observered in over 50 years). 
Of these, only 13% (75 species) are listed as ‘Possibly Extinct’ by the IUCN. 
We recorded species locations and looked at their correlation with mega-diverse countries, along with patterns associated with taxonomy and enviroment. 
We suggest minor adjustments to IUCN Red List accounts to allow lost species to be better tracked, including more consistent use of the ‘Possibly Extinct’ 
marker and wider application of the ‘last seen date’ field.
